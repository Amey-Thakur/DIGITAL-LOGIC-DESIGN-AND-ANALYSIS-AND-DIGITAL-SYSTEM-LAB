     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Digital Logic Design and Analysis (CSC302) and Digital System Lab (CSL301) are core subjects in the Second Year (Semester III) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. These courses establish the foundational understanding of digital systems, logic design principles, and hardware description languages crucial for computer architecture and embedded systems development.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key domains in digital electronics and logic design:

- **Number Systems and Codes**: Binary, octal, hexadecimal representations, BCD, Gray code, error detection and correction codes
- **Boolean Algebra and Logic Gates**: Boolean theorems, De Morgan's laws, universal gates (NAND/NOR), logic simplification
- **Combinational Logic Design**: Adders, subtractors, multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders, decoders, comparators
- **Sequential Logic Circuits**: Flip-flops, registers, counters, state machines, timing analysis
- **Memory and Programmable Logic**: RAM, ROM, PLA, PAL, FPGA fundamentals
- **VHDL Programming**: Hardware description language syntax, behavioral and structural modeling, simulation and synthesis

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, question papers, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As I progress in my career, I recognize that digital logic fundamentals remain essential for understanding computer architecture, embedded systems, and hardware-software interfaces. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental digital logic concepts
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through DLDA and Digital System Lab
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.
